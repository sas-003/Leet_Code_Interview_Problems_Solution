install coverage with $ pip install coverage
run
$ coverage run LinkedList.py  #analyses file
$ coverage report -m    #outputs anaylsys and shows un covered lines
$ coverage html           # create a more concise html version of the report
I try out a few things and get 10% code coverage
I then install pytest-cov using
another way to check it out
$ pip install pytest-cov
$ pytest --cov=app
and modify the test_app.py file until I get 100% code coverage
I also generate a html version of the report using
$ pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
